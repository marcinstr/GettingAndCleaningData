This is a description file for the Course Project of Getting and Cleaning Data Course at Johns Hopkins University via Coursera.

The description of the Course Project contained:

"Here are the data for the project:

 You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject."


In order to work with the R files provided as solution to the Project, please download data from the aforementioned webside, unzip it, 
and place it your working directory at R studio.

Then, please run the following code 

source("run_analysis.R")

This will generate the TinyData.txt file as requested in the objectives of the project.

Have fun!
